## Overview

This repository contains real information about the last earthquakes registered in the last 7 days, the option to choose the visualization of tectonic plates is displayed, and the possibility of choosing between 3 different types of maps.

## Data acquisition

The first step is to perform the earthquakes data acquisition from:

    https://earthquake.com

and the information is hosted within the repository.

A CirleMarker is used to display the magnitude of the earthquake, as the magnitude is colored and the marker is adjusted.

It is interesting to compare the magnitude and location of the earthquakes with the location of the limits with the tectonic plates in different types of maps.

## Conclusion

The way in which the data is visualized helps us to realize that a greater number of earthquakes are registered at the limits between tectonic plates.
